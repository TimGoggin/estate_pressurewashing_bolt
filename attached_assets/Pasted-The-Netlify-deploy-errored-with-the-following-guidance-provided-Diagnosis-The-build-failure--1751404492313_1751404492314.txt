The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by TypeScript errors related to unused declarations and missing properties in certain files in the project.

**Solution:**
1. To address the TypeScript errors, you need to fix the unused declarations and missing properties in the indicated files.
2. Specifically, you need to address the warnings like `'React' is declared but its value is never read` and `'fit' does not exist on type...` in the files mentioned in the build log.

After making the necessary changes to resolve the TypeScript errors, you can try building the project again.

The relevant error logs are:
